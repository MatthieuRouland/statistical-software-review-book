# Introduction {#intro}

The rOpenSci project, "Expanding Software Peer Review" has the two-fold aim to:

1. Expand the current scope of software reviewed by rOpenSci to include
   statistical software; and
2. Provide a documented framework to facilitate and enable the processes and
   protocols developed during this project to be adapted and translated onto
   other domains (other forms of software; other computer languages; and other
   forms of "other").

Most of the following sections and chapters of this document are accordingly
divided into two sequential sections, the first of which documents and
describes processes and protocols in general, and the second of which details
the specific application of those processes and protocols to the domain of
statistical software.
