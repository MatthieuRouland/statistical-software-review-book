# Introduction {#intro}

This is a book-form documentation of the development and implementation of
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ropensci.org">
rOpenSci</a>'s project to expand their 
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ropensci.org/packages">
peer review system</a> to encompass statistical software---the original and
still primary focus of the R language. This document is intended to function as
much as possible as a guidebook which not only describes how we went about
expanding our system of peer review into the new domain of statistical
software, but which may also be used as a set of guidelines on how such an
expansion of scope may be reproduced in other domains.
