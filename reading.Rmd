#  Some Light Reading: An Annotated Bibliography {#reading}

Note that the following annotated bibliography is automatically generated from
all entries containing "Note" fields in the [zotero library accompanying this
project](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2416765/statistical-software?). Please
feel free to add any additional entries you may see fit to this open library
according to the following steps:

1. Open your local [zotero client](https://zotero.org) and get a local copy of
   the [project
   library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2416765/statistical-software?);
2. Enable zotero in your web broswer so that you can click on any webpage to
   add an entry to the shared library;
3. Manually add a "Note" to any new entries and they'll automatically appear
   here the next time this page is updated.

This annotated bibliography extracts all text in all `Note` fields **up to the
first markdown section break**, itself defined by a single line with a least
three consecutive dashes as in the following example:
```{markdown zotero-note-ex, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
Add some note text to appear in this annotated bibliography

---

This text below the three dashes and any subsequent lines will not appear here.
```

Notes which do not contain a section break will appear here in their entirety.
