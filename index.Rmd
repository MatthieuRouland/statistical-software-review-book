# Welcome {#welcome}

Welcome to [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org)'s project
developing [software peer review](https://ropensci.org/software-review/) system
for statistical software in R packages and  beyond.  We invite you to join us in
developing standards for peer-reviewed evaluation of statistical software.

rOpenSci runs software peer review for R packages focused on data life cycle management.
To apply these processes to software implementing statistical methods and algorithms,
we need new ways of evaluating and testing software, and managing the review
process. This book serves as a home for collecting research and developing
those standards. As the book develops, it will become an extension of
[rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/),
documenting not only our guidelines for statistical software but also the process
of expanding the scope of review so it may be reproduced in other domains.

You are invited to contribute to this project by filing suggestions as
[issues in the book's GitHub repository](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/statistical-software-peer-review/issues).
We also have a dedicated [area for discussion on the rOpenSci forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/statistical-software-peer-review/28).
We have noted in the chapters we're actively seeking more input and feedback by
highlighting them their titles in <span style="color:red;">red and adding
`[SEEKING FEEDBACK]`</span> to them.  Feedback on other sections welcome, too
- but they may be more or less developed.

For this project we are lucky to have support of a great steering committee.  The
committee's role is to help us with outreach to statistical communities, vetting
community input and prioritizing our work. They are:

-   [Ben Bolker](https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/) ([\@bolkerb](https://twitter.com/bolkerb)) McMaster University
-   [Rebecca Killick](http://www.lancs.ac.uk/~killick/), Lancaster University
-   [Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) ([\@stephaniehicks](https://twitter.com/stephaniehicks)), Johns Hopkins University
-   [Max Kuhn](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/) ([\@topepos](https://twitter.com/topepos)), RStudio

This work is [
supported by the Sloan Foundation](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/07/15/expanding-software-review/)
and is organized under an
[R Consortium Working Group](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/isc-working-groups).
