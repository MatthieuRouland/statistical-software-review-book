This is the source repository for rOpenSci's Statistical Software Peer Review
project.  It is organized as a git book at <https://ropenscilabs.github.io/statistical-software-peer-review>.

rOpenSci runs software peer review for R packages focused on data lifecycle management.
To apply these processes to software implementing statistical methods and algorithms,
we need new ways of evaluating and testing software, and managing the review
process. This book serves as a home for collecting research and and developing
those standards. As the book develops, it book will become an extension of
[rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/),
documenting not only our guidelines for statistical software but also the process
of expanding this expansion of scope of review may be reproduced in other domains.

You are invited to contribute to this project by filing suggestions as
[issues in the book's GitHub repository](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/statistical-software-peer-review/issues).
We also have a dedicated [area for discussion on the rOpenSci forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/c/statistical-software-peer-review/28).

For this project we are lucky to have support of a great steering committee.  The
commitee's role is to help us with outreach to statistical communities, vetting
community input and prioritizing our work. They are:
